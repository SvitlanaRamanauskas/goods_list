# Additional Setup (If Applicable)

Setting Up TypeScript:

This project uses TypeScript for static type checking. If you need to modify TypeScript settings, make sure the tsconfig.json file is properly configured.

```npm install typescript --save-dev```

Setting Up SCSS:

The project uses SCSS for styling. Create React App automatically supports SCSS, but you need to have sass installed.

```npm install sass --save-dev```
This allows you to use .scss files for your styles.
